Developed a platform that connects recruiters and students, facilitating smooth recruitment and placement process. Jenkins automated CI/CD pipeline was used to deliver this. The backend and frontend services were packaged as distinct docker images and deployed on Google Cloud Platform's Kubernetes cluster. ELK stack was used to enable continuous monitoring of the backend requests
